Hello everyone!

Name's Radek. Just short from Radoslaw :)
My main purpose is to step into enviroment of energetic web/software developers.
I changed my whole career. First being as lifeguard at swimming pools, sea, lakes and scout camps during studies. The studies were concerning about optimazing...mostly production systems. Then I tried automotive. The goal was to gain experience in that field, which would help me with studies and studies would help me with promotion at work.
That doesn't work at all.

Then happened a short milestone - I changed field to infrastructure. I stepped into huge corporation - Budimex. Despite of benefits and (at last!) healthy enviroment in this corporation I didn't feel self-realization. My friends, at my age, changed their carreers. Mostly I heard to do what You like to do.
So I went for all.

Since November 2021 I have been learning programming.
I started with a book about JavaScript to take my first steps. I quickly started my adventure with Junior Courses at Codecademy. I was learning the basics of programming. Command line. Then Ruby. Then git and github. Then I changed my operating system from Windows to Ubuntu. Next was learning by using  guides.rubyonrails.org - Rails 7. Of course, during my studies, I use everyday docs: api.rubyonrails.org nad ruby-doc.org. The next stages were: HTML, CSS, SQL from w3schools. Then I cameback to codecademy. In meantime I tried a lot of proxy projects RoR.

I try to get to know and use all the tools that I will need for RoR. I try to create basic CRUD applications and put them on GitHub.
To expand my portfolio I tried also Advent of Code 2021.

I am also huge fan of fantasy tabletop games and roleplaying games.
Currently I am improving my knowledge and skill by trial and error and using these guides rails everyday.
